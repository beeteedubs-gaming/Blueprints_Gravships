This respository contains plans featured from [Beeteedubs Gaming's](https://www.youtube.com/@beeteedubsgaming) [Gravship Blueprints](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJr4sGCRNnwMfdDp1JhPaXJyiqVQekkPF) series on YouTube that can be used with the RimWorld mod [Extended Planning](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877392159). These are just the plans, a guide for you to use and reshape as you create your own plans.

To use these files in your game make sure you have Extended Planning installed, then place the desired .pln file in your planning folder. As an example my Planning folder is located here: C:\Users\beeteedubs\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Planning.

To find yours easily in game: open the menu > options > select to open your Log File Folder = this should open your RimWorld by Ludeon Studeos Folder directly.

If you do not see a "Planning" folder here it's because you have not saved any plans with the Extended Planning mod, you can create a new folder titled "Planning" and add your selected .pln files there.

Once in game open the Planning menu added by Extended Planning and select the option to Load Plan

**Naming Convention:**

[*Sorting Acronym*] - [*#*(number of extenders)][Max Tiles(*MT*) or Partial Tiles (*PT*)] [*Ship Name*]
- Examples:
  - ST - 6eMT Defiant
    - This would be The Defiant Class from Star Trek, 6 gravcore build using Max Tiles (2000/2000).
  - ST - 0eMT Defiant
    - This would be The Defiant Class from Star Trek, 0 gravcore build using Max Tiles (500/500).
  - STz - 6eMT Defiant
    - This would be The Defiant Class from Star Trek, 6 gravcore build using Max Tiles; the 'z' in "STz" indicates that this also has additional planning beyond the silhouette  + gravengine, gravcore & thruster placements. Notes below about this.
  
**Note:** Sorting Acroynym might be appended with a lower case 'z', this is to order it at the bottom of that portion of the list and to indicate it is a version of the plans that I've added additional detail to; placements for rooms, furniture, workbenches, etc. These versions of the plans are a lot more noisy than the silhouettes and may only make sense to me or if you watch me do a lot of planning.
