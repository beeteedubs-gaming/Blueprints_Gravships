This respository contains plans that can be used with the RimWorld Mod Extended Planning. These are just the plans, a guide, for you to use and reshape before you start laying your own plans and blueprints.

To use these files in your game make sure you have Extended Planning installed, then place the desired .pln file in your planning folder.

As an example my Planning folder is located here: C:\Users\beeteedubs\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Planning.

To find yours easily, in game, open the menu, go to options, select to open your Log File Folder and this should open your RimWorld by Ludeon Studeos Folder directly.

If you do not see a "Planning" folder here it's because you have not saved any plans with the Extended Planning mod, you can create a new folder titled "Planning" and add your selected .pln files there.

Once in game open the Planning menu added by Extended Planning and select the option to Load Plan
