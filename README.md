RimWorld Gravships
This respository contains plans that can be used with the RimWorld Mod Extended Planning.

To use these files in your game make sure you have Extended Planning installed, then place the desired .pln file in your planning folder.

As an example my Planning folder is located here: C:\Users\beeteedubs\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Planning.

To find yours easily, in game, open the menu, go to options, select to open your Save Data Folder, then navigate one folder up to land in your RimWorld by Ludeon Studeos Folder
If you do not see a "Planning" folder here it's because you have not saved any plans with the Extended Planning mod, you can create a new folder titled "Planning" and add your selected .pln files there.

Once in game open the Planning menu added by Extended Planning and select the option to Load Plan
