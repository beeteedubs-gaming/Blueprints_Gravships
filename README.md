This respository contains plans that can be used with the RimWorld mod [Extended Planning](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2877392159). These are just the plans, a guide, for you to use and reshape as you create your own plans.

To use these files in your game make sure you have Extended Planning installed, then place the desired .pln file in your planning folder. As an example my Planning folder is located here: C:\Users\beeteedubs\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Planning.

To find yours easily, in game, open the menu, go to options, select to open your Log File Folder and this should open your RimWorld by Ludeon Studeos Folder directly.

If you do not see a "Planning" folder here it's because you have not saved any plans with the Extended Planning mod, you can create a new folder titled "Planning" and add your selected .pln files there.

Once in game open the Planning menu added by Extended Planning and select the option to Load Plan

**Naming Convention:**

[*Franchise Acronym*] - [*Ship Name*] [*# of gravcores*][*Max Tiles(MT) or Partial Tiles (PT)*]
- Example: ST - Defiant 6cMT
  - This would be The Defiant Class from Star Trek, 6 gravcore build using Max Tiles.
  
Additionally, the Franchise Acroynym might be appended with a lower case 'z', this is to order it at the bottom of that portion of the list, and indicate it's a version of the plans that I've added additional detail to; placements for rooms, furniture, workbenches, etc. These versions of the plans are a lot more noisy than the silhouettes and may only make sense to me or if you watch me do a lot of planning.
